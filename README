Hockeypuck: OpenPGP Key Server
==============================

This is a fork of the regular Hockeypuck PGP server, focused on 
replacing the backend with the Neo4j graph database. It is in
very early stages. Also, we'll change the name as soon as we 
come up with a better one.

Running hockeypuck with Neo4j
